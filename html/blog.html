                   <span> Task” </span> any work we want a machine to perform, <br>

                   As individuals, We believe that “ every problem has a solution&rdquo. We truly focus on the problems and try to fetch the possible outcomes to solve those problems as a result it improves the overall mental capacity of a person’s mind to tackle the situation. We know students are always in learning mode, their mind is always in a competitive state so students take that as a challenge and put all efforts to solve the problem. <br>

                </span>  <br>Learning new technologies, helps students to become self reliant and they can use their knowledge in any field of their interest. It is a key to unlock the opportunities available worldwide in software programming and application development.</p></span>

                <h2>Top 5 Programming Languages In 2022</h2>
                
                <p class="text1">Language is an essential feature of software development. Learning any language is not an easy task, and it takes lots of effort to learn and implement any programming language to develop software. <br>
                    <span > 1. JavaScript</span> <br>
                    JavaScript is the most loved language by programmers. In todays time, JavaScript has grown its popularity in the developers community. <br>
                   <span> But why is it so?</span> <br>
                    
                    ● Like it is very handy to use. <br>
                    ● You don need any prior language knowledge of any programming language just need the basics of JavaScript concepts. <br>
                    ● This language simplifies some complex concepts in other languages. <br>
                   <span>2.Python</span> <br>
● Python has become the highest learning programming language in 2020. Python is a minified version of C. If you have prior knowledge of C then it is a piece of cake to learn python. <br>
● Python has become many developers first twice as python provides web assistance in a Django framework. As a student to understand basics of programming you must learn python. In top MNC python developers were in demand. <br>
<span >3. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) </span> <br>
● PHP is a server-side scripting language. As a student who wants to become a Web Developer PHP language is a good option to start with. Most of the website in today date is build on PHP and maintenance is build on PHP and maintenance also quite easy in PHP. <br>

The popularity of PHP is based on various factors.● PHP runs on various platforms <span> (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc).</span> <br>
                     
            
                  <span class="moreText1"> <span > 4. Java </span> <br>
                    ● Java is the most trusted and veteran language in the IT industry. Like C, Java also has a vast following in the IT industry now. But why is it so, in the market but still people use Java as their priority language to start learning? <br>
                    ● As an early student in programming Java is the mother language to learn, it covers all concepts in programming with advanced concepts as well. Java also uses for competitive programming. Most of the top coders use Java as their main language in competitive language. <br>
                <span>5. C language</span> <br>

                
                ● C is a veteran language that is developed by language in programming. According to my, every student must start with the C language which is developed by <span> Dennis Richie in 1972. </span> <br>
                ● It gained popularity, and it is used as the most widely used programming language. Various computer architecture and operating systems were build on C. As of Sept 2020, C is the most popular programming language. <br>
                ● As it is the first programming language it has some drawbacks as well, this leads to the creation of upgraded languages like C++, C#, etc? <br>

                <h2>The Rise Of E-learning During Covid-19 pandemic </h2>
                
                <p class="text2"> <span> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, education has significantly changed. </span> <br>
                    The global pandemic has drastically changed the way students are learning worldwide and thus distinctive online learning has taken place. Students from all around the world have suddenly shifted from classroom learning to online learning and some are even wondering whether such change will continue even after the global pandemic is over. <br>
                    
                   <span>Investing in education technology is imperative. </span> <br>
                    It is visible more than ever that investment in education technology as well as its integration in schools is highly important in order to provide a seamless transition to online learning to students. Therefore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential for educational institutions to provide their students with a user-friendly online learning platform in order to sustain quality learning. <br>
                    
                   
                  <span class="moreText2">
                   <span> Increase in the demand for blended learning. </span> <br>
                    There is a high chance that after the pandemic there will be an increase in the demand for a hybrid learning model and thus a combination of online and campus-based learning will emerge, also known as blended learning. Numerous research has also identified online learning to be even more efficient in some cases than classroom learning. For example, online learning allows students to learn at a quicker speed by learning at their own pace, re-reading and re-taking the pre-recorded lectures as well as they have the opportunity to go through the topics as they choose in some cases.

                <h2>Eat Sleep Code And Repeat </h2>
                
                <p class="text3"> 
                    <span>The “Eat, sleep, code, repeat” phrase is intended to be a way of saying “coding is awesome and we want to do it all the time!”. I get the point, I appreciate the enthusiasm, I do. </span> <br>
                    Have you heard of the statement “programmers have no life?” that is absolutely wrong! Programmers do have a life. <br>

Programmers have numerous interests and talents far outside their ability code. It could be reading, art, hiking, running, writing, spending time in nature, or just hanging out with family and friends. <br>

A programmer needs to have a truly balanced lifestyle — one that gives the brain some space to breath non-programming air. Life outside of code helps nurture important qualities and skills: inspiration, creativity, patience, flexibility and many more. All of these skills make you a better programmer and you can not acquired them by just coding. <br>
                   
                  <span class="moreText3">
                   <span> In summary </span>
                    Don’t believe the hype that if you don’t spend all your night awake or non-eating hours programming, you’ll not be a good programmer. <br>
                    
                    If you want to become the very best programmer you can be, make out time for some non-coding activities. Let your brain stretch it’s legs and breath some non-programming air. <br>
                    
                    “Eat, sleep, code, repeat”.  <br>
                    <span> In essence, the main takeaways are as following: </span>

 1. Don’t get caught up in your own thoughts, collaborate with your team, share your thoughts. <br>
2. Understanding that people come from different backgrounds and that communication is important. <br>
3. Running your thoughts by people outside of your team can introduce a fresh approach to your problems. <br>
